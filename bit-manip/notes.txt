I somehow feel a need to learn bit manipulation.

[DS] Bits could be a great way to tightly pack "switching" info {ON, OFF} or boolean values.
[Computing] Bits could also be tweaked to evaluate individual ints or chars.

The best way to access and store bits is to use 'ints'.
    Because there is a certain wordsize the compiler or the computer is comfortable in dealing with.
Each 'int' is (4) 'bytes' = (32) 'bits'.
Thus, for and integer_array[size] ; the number of bits available are (size * 32);

----Bit-wise Operations------- 
NOT     (~)
AND     (&)
OR      (|)
XOR     (^)
SHIFTs  (>> , <<)

--------Interesting Data Structures of bits [DS]--------
1. bit array
2. bit field 
3. bit map

-----------------------------------------------
~ All integral data types (char, int, long..) are capable of representing bits.
~ Unsigned int are better used for bit manipulation.
