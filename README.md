# Home Brewed Data Structures
I felt a need to make my own Data Structures. 

### 30/04/23
Turning out to be a learning excercise more than anything else.

A data-structure is chosen as per needs.
Sometimes, a best fit given up over STL (C++) 
    because it communicates better with other developers.

I halted on my work here for a very long time.
Anyway, I feel I should continue (or restart) my work here in C.
Why the change in language? C++ is fine as well, but I want two things.
Firstly, C is a primitive language than C and without OOPs and classes.
This will make sure that I am focusing only on learning the DS and Algorithms.
Moreover, the absence of a robust STL and other complications also enforces me to make all things again.
I would be coerced into the grunt work.
Second, C would be somewhat of a change in language. somewhat. This will test how well
I absorbed the fundamental concepts inherent in DSA, which is language independent.

Also, I would want to be able to talk more than I code. Code is the manifestation of (technical) thoughts.
I would want to examine how I think in the raw than judge it through code.
It also consolidates my communication aptitude, I hope.

Coming back to DSA study. It is all mathematics, a very constricted and dicrete form of it.
But there are also extra steps, to be able tell the computer to work on your DSA code.
You need some grasp on coding languages and also be able to type as quickly as you think.
Trivial but worth mentioning nonetheless.
I have contemplated on the idea of coding as you think. Is it possible? I have always thought about it 
when I did mathematics, all the topological, analysis and algebra concepts. Can I be able to work them out as naturally as possible. Because I believe using these naturally will only invoke their effect in actuality.
I wonder.
