# Home-brewed Data Structures
I felt a need to make my own Data Structures.
Although C++ STL (and other prog langs) is facilitated Data Structure,
I reckoned it would be a great learning excercise to create my own.
These could come with their special utility with tweaked efficiency.
It will be fun, I suppose.
