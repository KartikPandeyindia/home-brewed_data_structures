# Home Brewed Data Structures
I felt a need to make my own Data Structures. 

### 30/04/23
Turning out to be a learning excercise more than anything else.

A data-structure is chosen as per needs.
Sometimes, a best fit given up over STL (C++) 
    because it communicates better with other developers.

### 22/09/23
I halted on my work here for a very long time.
Anyway, I feel I should continue (or restart) my work here in C.
Why the change in language? C++ is fine as well, but I want two things.
Firstly, C is a primitive language than C++ and without OOPs and classes.
This will make sure that I am focusing only on learning the DS and Algorithms.
Moreover, the absence of a robust STL and other complications also enforces me to make all things again.
I would be coerced into the grunt work.
Second, C would be somewhat of a change in language. somewhat. This will test how well
I absorbed the fundamental concepts inherent in DSA, which is language independent.

Also, I would want to be able to talk more than I code. Code is the manifestation of (technical) thoughts.
I would want to examine how I think in the raw than judge it through code.
It also consolidates my communication aptitude, I hope.

Coming back to DSA study. It is all mathematics, a very constricted and dicrete form of it.
But there are also extra steps, to be able tell the computer to work on your DSA code.
You need some grasp on coding languages and also be able to type as quickly as you think.
Trivial but worth mentioning nonetheless.
I have contemplated on the idea of coding as you think. Is it possible? I have always thought about it 
when I did mathematics, all the topological, analysis and algebra concepts. Can I be able to work them out as naturally as possible. Because I believe using these naturally will only invoke their effect in actuality.
I wonder.

When I said home-brewed; I didn't mean to create my own new DS because I can't but I'll try to sketch out the generic or unique ones or whatever that piques my interest.
Moving this way forward, I feel why not extend this idea to Algorithms? I am doing nothing out of new just remaking things. This is very possible, fun and useful. I always wondered there would be (as there are) more interesting algorithms other than the standard one of sorting and searching taught to us. I am specially interested in Signal Processing, Time Series and Neural Network one. They are specially interesting to me.
However, I'll start with the standard ones first.

### 07/10/23
I should still learn to write leetcode problems in C++. Because it just happens to be more popular; I would benefit more from learning a shared language than one that is foreign. I am very certain of one thing, that you write code for others.

### 10/10/24
A long break, It has been a year since I last updated this. 
1. I always wanted to learn DSA, but I believe I was intimidated by the challenge it posed. I thought, I must have something missing like a background in more abstract mathematics or maybe a refresher in programming language.
But, now that I am certain, that is not the case. 
I know now that I have to leverage a peculiar "intuitive jump" in training myself some of these out-of-reach concepts, and not get dissuaded by the challenged. 
2. Refering to the note on 22/09/23. I know now, how I could be able to evoke all the concept fluently and concurrently in my mindspace. I am positive on my abilities to do that now. To say more about how, it that these concepts exist in our mind as mathematical wrangled abstract sets, which have been beautifully wrapped and presented by educative material. To get hands-on with them, break apart and rebuild them, tinker and mingle them, manipulate, transform and reinterpret them... is how we derive more command and expertise over these concepts. This takes a long time with no end criteria.  

One more thing, I don't know, how I was pursuing this study earlier. However, I would like to disclose that from now here too. It just helps me get the perspective right after a long break like this.

* I stan this material online [link](https://cp-algorithms.com/index.html)
* What I want to religiously follow is a textbook [link](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/kleinberg-tardos/) 
* And this culminates into practicing problems at Leetcode [link](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/)
